   - Reiterate the importance of the findings and their relevance to the BAIS field.
   - Propose recommendations for businesses based on your results.

10. **References:**
    - List all the sources cited in your project.
    - Follow the appropriate citation style as per your course guidelines (e.g., APA, MLA).

11. **Appendices (if applicable):**
    - Include any additional material that supports your project (e.g., raw data, detailed calculations, additional code).
    - Label each appendix clearly and refer to them in the main text where relevant.

#### Project Completion Outline
