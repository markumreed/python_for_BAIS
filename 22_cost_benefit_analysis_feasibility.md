# Python Practical: Building Cost-Benefit Analysis Tools Using Python

## Introduction

In this tutorial, students will use Python to build tools that facilitate cost-benefit analysis, applying their theoretical knowledge in a hands-on setting. Using libraries such as Pandas for data management and Matplotlib or Plotly for visualization, students will create automated systems that can calculate, analyze, and present cost-benefit scenarios. This exercise will enhance both Python programming skills and the ability to apply these skills to real-world economic evaluations in project management.

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with cost-benefit analysis concepts

## 1. Setting Up the Python Development Environment

### Step 1: Install Python
Download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Step 2: Verify Installation
Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run the following command to verify that Python is installed correctly:
```bash
python --version
```
or
```bash
python3 --version
```
You should see the installed Python version.

### Step 3: Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib plotly
```

## 2. Loading and Managing Cost-Benefit Data

### Example Cost-Benefit Data
Let's assume we have a CSV file named `cost_benefit_data.csv` with the following columns:
- `Item`
- `Cost`
- `Benefit`
- `Year`

#### Step 1: Create a Project Directory
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:
```bash
mkdir cost_benefit_analysis
cd cost_benefit_analysis
```

#### Step 2: Create the Cost-Benefit Analysis Script
Create a file named `cost_benefit_analysis.py` and open it in your IDE. Add the following code to load and manage the data:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the cost-benefit data
data = pd.read_csv('cost_benefit_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
print(data.head())

# Data preprocessing
# Handle missing values
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Display basic statistics
print(data.describe())
```

**Discussion:**
1. **Loading the Data:** We use Pandas to read the CSV file into a DataFrame. The `read_csv` function is straightforward and automatically detects the structure of the CSV file.
2. **Displaying Data:** The `head` function shows the first few rows of the dataset, giving an initial look at the data.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values using `dropna` cleans the dataset by removing any rows with missing values.
4. **Displaying Statistics:** The `describe` function provides basic statistical details about the dataset, such as mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.

#### Step 3: Run Your Script
Run your script from the terminal:
```bash
python cost_benefit_analysis.py
```

## 3. Calculating Net Present Value (NPV)

### Step 1: Define the NPV Function
Add the following code to define a function that calculates the NPV of a series of cash flows:

```python
def calculate_npv(data, discount_rate):
    data['Net Cash Flow'] = data['Benefit'] - data['Cost']
    npv = 0
    for i, row in data.iterrows():
        npv += row['Net Cash Flow'] / ((1 + discount_rate) ** row['Year'])
    return npv

# Example usage
discount_rate = 0.05
npv = calculate_npv(data, discount_rate)
print(f"Net Present Value (NPV): ${npv:.2f}")
```

**Discussion:**
1. **Calculating Net Cash Flow:** The `Net Cash Flow` is calculated as the difference between `Benefit` and `Cost` for each item.
2. **Calculating NPV:** The NPV is calculated by discounting each net cash flow to its present value using the formula \( \text{NPV} = \sum \frac{\text{Net Cash Flow}}{(1 + \text{discount rate})^{\text{Year}}} \). This sum gives the NPV of the cash flows.

### Step 2: Run Your Script
Run your script from the terminal:
```bash
python cost_benefit_analysis.py
```

## 4. Visualizing Cost-Benefit Scenarios

### Step 1: Visualize Cost and Benefit Over Time
Add the following code to visualize the cost and benefit over time using Matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_cost_benefit(data):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(data['Year'], data['Cost'], label='Cost', marker='o')
    plt.plot(data['Year'], data['Benefit'], label='Benefit', marker='o')
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Amount')
    plt.title('Cost and Benefit Over Time')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

# Example usage
plot_cost_benefit(data)
```

**Discussion:**
1. **Plotting Cost and Benefit:** We use Matplotlib's `plot` function to create line plots for `Cost` and `Benefit` over time. The `marker='o'` parameter adds markers to the data points for better visualization.
2. **Adding Labels and Titles:** The `xlabel`, `ylabel`, and `title` functions add labels and a title to the plot. The `legend` function adds a legend to differentiate between cost and benefit lines, and `grid` adds grid lines to the plot for better readability.

### Step 2: Run Your Script
Run your script from the terminal:
```bash
python cost_benefit_analysis.py
```

### Step 3: Interactive Visualization with Plotly
Add the following code to create an interactive plot using Plotly:

```python
import plotly.express as px

def plot_cost_benefit_interactive(data):
    fig = px.line(data, x='Year', y=['Cost', 'Benefit'], markers=True, title='Cost and Benefit Over Time')
    fig.update_layout(yaxis_title='Amount', xaxis_title='Year')
    fig.show()

# Example usage
plot_cost_benefit_interactive(data)
```

**Discussion:**
1. **Plotly Express:** Plotly Express simplifies the creation of interactive plots. The `line` function creates a line plot with markers.
2. **Updating Layout:** The `update_layout` function customizes the layout, including titles for the x and y axes.

### Step 4: Run Your Script
Run your script from the terminal:
```bash
python cost_benefit_analysis.py
```

## 5. Automating the Analysis Process

### Step 1: Creating Functions for Reusability
Refactor the code into functions to automate the analysis process:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px

def load_data(file_path):
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    data.dropna(inplace=True)
    return data

def calculate_npv(data, discount_rate):
    data['Net Cash Flow'] = data['Benefit'] - data['Cost']
    npv = 0
    for i, row in data.iterrows():
        npv += row['Net Cash Flow'] / ((1 + discount_rate) ** row['Year'])
    return npv

def plot_cost_benefit(data):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(data['Year'], data['Cost'], label='Cost', marker='o')
    plt.plot(data['Year'], data['Benefit'], label='Benefit', marker='o')
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Amount')
    plt.title('Cost and Benefit Over Time')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

def plot_cost_benefit_interactive(data):
    fig = px.line(data, x='Year', y=['Cost', 'Benefit'], markers=True, title='Cost and Benefit Over Time')
    fig.update_layout(yaxis_title='Amount', xaxis_title='Year')
    fig.show()

def main():
    data = load_data('cost_benefit_data.csv')
    print(data.head())
    print(data.describe())
    
    discount_rate = 0.05
    npv = calculate_npv(data, discount_rate)
    print(f"Net Present Value (NPV): ${npv:.2f}")
    
    plot_cost_benefit(data)
    plot_cost_benefit_interactive(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Discussion:**
1. **Loading Data:** The `load_data` function reads the CSV file and removes any rows with missing values.
2. **Calculating NPV:** The `calculate_npv` function computes the NPV of the cash flows.
3. **Plotting Functions:** The `plot_cost_benefit` and `plot_cost_benefit_interactive` functions create static and interactive plots, respectively.
4. **Main Function:** The `main` function orchestrates the entire analysis process, calling each function in sequence.

### Step 2: Run Your Script
Run your script from the terminal:
```bash
python cost_benefit_analysis.py
```
This will execute all the analysis functions sequentially, automating the entire cost-benefit analysis process.
