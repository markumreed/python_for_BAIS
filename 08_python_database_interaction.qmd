# Deep Dive Tutorial on SQLite3 for Interacting with SQLite Databases in Python

SQLite is a lightweight, disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process. Python’s built-in `sqlite3` module provides an interface for interacting with SQLite databases. In this tutorial, we'll cover the following topics with complete working examples:

1. **Setting up the SQLite Database**
2. **Inserting Data**
3. **Querying Data**
4. **Updating Data**
5. **Deleting Data**
6. **Exporting Data to CSV**
7. **Importing Data from CSV**
8. **Handling Errors**

## 1. Setting up the SQLite Database

First, let's create a SQLite database and a table for our data. We'll create an `employees` table with columns for `id`, `name`, `position`, `salary`, and `hire_date`.

```python
import sqlite3
import datetime

# Connect to the database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Drop the table if it exists to recreate it with the correct schema
cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees")

# Create a table with a date column
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE employees
                  (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, position TEXT, salary REAL, hire_date TEXT)''')

# Insert a date
now = datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary, hire_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
               ('Bob', 'Developer', 65000, now))
conn.commit()

# Query dates
cursor.execute("SELECT name, hire_date FROM employees")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)

conn.close()
```

## 2. Inserting Data

Next, we will insert some rows into our `employees` table.

```python
import sqlite3
import datetime

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Insert a row of data
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary, hire_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
               ('John Doe', 'Software Engineer', 75000, datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()))
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary, hire_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
               ('Jane Doe', 'Project Manager', 90000, datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()))

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

## 3. Querying Data

Let's query all rows from our `employees` table.

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query all rows
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Print each row
for row in rows:
    print(row)

conn.close()
```

## 4. Updating Data

We can update existing rows in our `employees` table.

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Update a row of data
cursor.execute("UPDATE employees SET salary = 80000 WHERE name = 'John Doe'")

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

## 5. Deleting Data

We can also delete rows from our `employees` table.

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Delete a row of data
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe'")

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

## 6. Exporting Data to CSV

We can export data from our `employees` table to a CSV file.

```python
import sqlite3
import csv

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Export data to CSV
with open('employees.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])
    writer.writerows(rows)

conn.close()
```

## 7. Importing Data from CSV

We can import data from a CSV file into our `employees` table.

```python
import sqlite3
import csv

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees")
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE employees
                  (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, position TEXT, salary REAL, hire_date TEXT)''')

# Import data from CSV
with open('employees.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    next(reader)  # Skip header row
    for row in reader:
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)", row)
conn.commit()

conn.close()
```

## 8. Handling Errors

Finally, let's handle potential errors that might occur during database operations.

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

try:
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('Invalid Data')")
    conn.commit()
except sqlite3.Error as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)

conn.close()
```

# Deep Dive Tutorial on SQLAlchemy for Interacting with Databases in Python

SQLAlchemy is a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. This tutorial will take you through the steps of using SQLAlchemy to interact with databases, focusing on creating tables, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and establishing relationships between tables. 

## Setting Up the Environment

First, install SQLAlchemy if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy
```

## Creating the Engine and Base

The engine is the starting point for any SQLAlchemy application. It represents the core interface to the database. The base class is used to define our classes.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Create the engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///example.db', echo=True)

# Define the base class
Base = declarative_base()
```

## Defining Models

We'll define two models, `Department` and `Employee`, to represent our tables.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float, DateTime, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
import datetime

# Define the Department class
class Department(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'departments'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, unique=True)
    employees = relationship('Employee', back_populates='department')

# Define the Employee class
class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    position = Column(String)
    salary = Column(Float)
    hire_date = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow)
    department_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('departments.id'))
    department = relationship('Department', back_populates='employees')
```

## Creating Tables

Drop existing tables and create new ones to ensure a clean state.

```python
# Drop all tables (for a clean start, especially during development)
Base.metadata.drop_all(engine)

# Create all tables
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

## Creating a Session

A session is used to interact with the database.

```python
# Create a session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
```

## Inserting Data

Create a department and add employees to it.

```python
# Create a new department
it_department = Department(name='IT')

# Add the department to the session and commit to get the department ID
session.add(it_department)
session.commit()

# Create new employees
employee1 = Employee(name='John Doe', position='Software Engineer', salary=70000, department=it_department)
employee2 = Employee(name='Jane Smith', position='Data Scientist', salary=90000, department=it_department)

# Add the employees to the session
session.add(employee1)
session.add(employee2)

# Commit the changes to the database
session.commit()
```

## Querying Data

Retrieve data from the database.

```python
# Query all employees
employees = session.query(Employee).all()
for employee in employees:
    print(f'{employee.name} works as a {employee.position} in the {employee.department.name} department.')

# Query specific employee by name
employee = session.query(Employee).filter_by(name='John Doe').first()
print(f'{employee.name} was hired on {employee.hire_date}')
```

## Updating Data

Update an employee's salary.

```python
# Update an employee's salary
employee = session.query(Employee).filter_by(name='John Doe').first()
employee.salary = 75000
session.commit()
```

## Deleting Data

Delete an employee from the database.

```python
# Delete an employee
employee = session.query(Employee).filter_by(name='John Doe').first()
session.delete(employee)
session.commit()
```

## Querying Relationships

Query employees by department.

```python
# Query employees by department
department = session.query(Department).filter_by(name='IT').first()
for employee in department.employees:
    print(f'{employee.name} works in the IT department.')
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to use SQLAlchemy to manage your database operations effectively.
