## Introduction to Data Handling and File I/O in Python

Handling data and performing file input/output (I/O) operations are fundamental tasks in any programming language. Python provides robust tools and libraries to manage data storage, read and write files, and manipulate different file formats. This tutorial will cover reading and writing files in Python, managing data storage, and performing operations on files using libraries such as `pandas`, `csv`, and `json`.

### Reading and Writing Text Files

Text files are the most basic form of file handling in Python. You can use built-in functions to read from and write to text files.

#### Reading Text Files

To read a text file, you use the `open` function in read mode (`'r'`).

```{python}
# Read a text file
with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

#### Writing Text Files

To write to a text file, you use the `open` function in write mode (`'w'`).

```{python}
# Write to a text file
with open('sample.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, World!')
```

### Handling CSV Files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are commonly used to store tabular data. Python provides the `csv` module to handle CSV files.

#### Reading CSV Files

You can read a CSV file using the `csv.reader` function.

```{python}
import csv

# Read a CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

#### Writing CSV Files

You can write to a CSV file using the `csv.writer` function.

```{python}
import csv

# Write to a CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Name', 'Age', 'Department'])
    writer.writerow(['John Doe', 30, 'Finance'])
    writer.writerow(['Jane Smith', 25, 'Marketing'])
```

### Handling JSON Files

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. Python provides the `json` module to handle JSON files.

#### Reading JSON Files

You can read a JSON file using the `json.load` function.

```{python}
import json

# Read a JSON file
with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    print(data)
```

#### Writing JSON Files

You can write to a JSON file using the `json.dump` function.

```{python}
import json

# Write to a JSON file
data = [{
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'age': 30,
    'department': 'Finance'
}]

with open('data.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)
```

### Data Manipulation with Pandas

Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly.

#### Reading CSV Files with Pandas

You can read a CSV file into a DataFrame using `pandas.read_csv`.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Read a CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df)
```

#### Writing CSV Files with Pandas

You can write a DataFrame to a CSV file using `DataFrame.to_csv`.

```{python}
# Write a DataFrame to a CSV file
df.to_csv('data_output.csv', index=False)
```

#### Reading JSON Files with Pandas

You can read a JSON file into a DataFrame using `pandas.read_json`.


```{python}
df=pd.read_json("data.json")
print(df)
```

#### Writing JSON Files with Pandas

You can write a DataFrame to a JSON file using `DataFrame.to_json`.

```{python}
# Write a DataFrame to a JSON file
df.to_json('data_output.json', orient='records', indent=4)
```

### Example: Processing Sales Data

Let's combine these concepts to read sales data from a CSV file, manipulate it using Pandas, and then save the results to a JSON file.

1. **Read Sales Data from a CSV File**

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Read sales data from a CSV file
sales_df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')
print(sales_df)
```

2. **Manipulate Data**

Calculate the total sales for each product.

```{python}
# Calculate total sales for each product
sales_df['Total Sales'] = sales_df['Quantity'] * sales_df['Unit Price']
print(sales_df)
```

3. **Write the Results to a JSON File**

```{python}
# Write the results to a JSON file
sales_df.to_json('sales_data_output.json', orient='records', indent=4)
```

### Conclusion

Handling data and performing file I/O operations are crucial skills for any programmer. Python's built-in functions and libraries like `pandas`, `csv`, and `json` make it easy to read, write, and manipulate different file formats. By mastering these tools, you can efficiently process data inputs and outputs in any system, making your programs more powerful and versatile.

```

## Reading and Writing CSV Files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are commonly used for data storage and exchange in business analytics.

### Reading CSV Files

```{python}
import csv

# Read CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

# Read CSV file into a dictionary
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

### Writing CSV Files

```{python}
import csv

# Write to a CSV file
with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Name', 'Age', 'Department'])

data = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 30,
    'department': 'HR'
}

with open('output.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)
```

## Database Interaction

Interacting with databases is essential for managing and querying large datasets in business analytics.

### Connecting to a SQLite Database

```{python}
import sqlite3

# Connect to database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER, department TEXT)')

# Insert data
cursor.execute('INSERT INTO employees (name, age, department) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', ('Alice', 30, 'HR'))
conn.commit()

# Query data
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM employees')
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

## Working with Large Data Sets

Handling large datasets efficiently is crucial in business analytics. The `pandas` library is often used for this purpose.

### Reading Large CSV Files in Chunks

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read CSV file in chunks
chunk_size = 1000
chunks = pd.read_csv('large_data.csv', chunksize=chunk_size)

for chunk in chunks:
    process(chunk)  # Replace with actual processing logic
```

## Practical Examples in BAIS

### Sales Data Analysis

**Example: Analyzing Sales Data**

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Read sales data from CSV
sales_data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Calculate total sales
total_sales = sales_data['Sales'].sum()
print(f'Total Sales: {total_sales}')

# Group sales by region
sales_by_region = sales_data.groupby('Region')['Sales'].sum()
print(sales_by_region)
```

### Customer Data Management

**Example: Managing Customer Data**

```{python}
import json

# Read customer data from JSON
with open('customers.json', 'r') as file:
    customers = json.load(file)

# Filter customers by age
young_customers = [customer for customer in customers if customer['age'] < 30]
print(young_customers)

# Write filtered data to new JSON file
with open('young_customers.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(young_customers, file, indent=4)
```

## Best Practices for Data Handling and File I/O

1. **Use Context Managers**: Always use context managers (`with` statements) for file operations to ensure proper resource management.
2. **Exception Handling**: Implement exception handling to manage errors during file operations.
3. **Data Validation**: Validate data before processing to avoid errors and inconsistencies.
4. **Efficient Processing**: Use efficient data processing techniques, especially for large datasets.
