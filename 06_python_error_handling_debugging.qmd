## Introduction to Error Handling and Debugging in Python

Error handling and debugging are crucial skills for any programmer. Proper error handling ensures your program can handle unexpected situations gracefully, while effective debugging techniques help you find and fix bugs more efficiently. This tutorial will cover implementing error handling in Python using `try-except` blocks and introduce debugging techniques using built-in Python functionalities and IDE tools like Visual Studio Code.

### Error Handling in Python

Error handling in Python is managed using `try-except` blocks, which allow you to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, preventing your program from crashing unexpectedly.

#### Basic Try-Except Block

The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors, and the `except` block lets you handle the error.

##### Example: Handling Division by Zero

```{python}
def divide(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        result = None
    return result

# Test the function
print(divide(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0
print(divide(10, 0))  # Output: Error: Division by zero is not allowed. None
```

#### Catching Multiple Exceptions

You can catch multiple exceptions by specifying different `except` blocks for each type of error.

##### Example: Handling Different Errors

```{python}
def read_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
        content = None
    except IOError:
        print(f"Error: Could not read the file '{filename}'.")
        content = None
    return content

# Test the function
print(read_file('existing_file.txt'))  # Outputs file content
print(read_file('non_existing_file.txt'))  # Output: Error: The file 'non_existing_file.txt' was not found.
```

#### Using Else and Finally

The `else` block can be used to execute code if no exceptions are raised, and the `finally` block can be used to execute code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.

##### Example: Else and Finally Blocks

```{python}
def process_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
    else:
        print("File read successfully.")
        return content
    finally:
        print("Finished file processing.")

# Test the function
process_file('existing_file.txt')  # Output: File read successfully. Finished file processing.
process_file('non_existing_file.txt')  # Output: Error: The file 'non_existing_file.txt' was not found. Finished file processing.
```

### Debugging Techniques

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs in your code. Effective debugging involves understanding the flow of your program and identifying where it deviates from expected behavior.

#### Print Statements

One of the simplest debugging techniques is using print statements to track the flow of your program and inspect variables.

##### Example: Using Print Statements

```{python}
def calculate_total_price(price, quantity):
    print(f"Price: {price}, Quantity: {quantity}")
    total = price * quantity
    print(f"Total: {total}")
    return total

# Test the function
calculate_total_price(10, 5)
```

#### Using the Built-in `pdb` Module

Python's built-in `pdb` module provides an interactive debugger that allows you to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables.

##### Example: Using `pdb` for Debugging

```{python}
import pdb

def calculate_total_price(price, quantity):
    pdb.set_trace()  # Set a breakpoint
    total = price * quantity
    return total

# Test the function
calculate_total_price(10, 5)
```

Run the script in your terminal, and the `pdb` debugger will start at the breakpoint, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.

#### Debugging with Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular IDE that provides powerful debugging tools. Here’s how to use VS Code for debugging Python code:

1. **Set Up a Debug Configuration**:
    - Open VS Code and load your Python project.
    - Click on the Debug icon on the left sidebar.
    - Click on the gear icon to open the `launch.json` file.
    - Add a new configuration for Python:
      ```json
      {
          "name": "Python: Current File",
          "type": "python",
          "request": "launch",
          "program": "${file}"
      }
      ```

2. **Set Breakpoints**:
    - Click in the gutter next to the line number where you want to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear, indicating a breakpoint.

3. **Start Debugging**:
    - Click the green play button in the Debug panel or press `F5` to start debugging.
    - The program will run until it hits a breakpoint, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and evaluate expressions.

#### Example: Debugging with VS Code

1. Open your Python script in VS Code.
2. Set a breakpoint in the `calculate_total_price` function.
3. Start the debugger and inspect the variables when the breakpoint is hit.

```{python}
def calculate_total_price(price, quantity):
    total = price * quantity
    return total

# Test the function
calculate_total_price(10, 5)
```

### Conclusion

Error handling and debugging are essential skills for writing robust and reliable Python programs. By using `try-except` blocks, you can gracefully handle errors and ensure your program runs smoothly. Debugging techniques, such as print statements, the `pdb` module, and IDE tools like Visual Studio Code, help you identify and fix bugs more efficiently. Mastering these skills will make you a more effective and productive programmer.

## Introduction to Error Handling

Error handling in Python is managed using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. These constructs allow you to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring that your program can recover from errors or exit cleanly.

## `try` and `except` Blocks

The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors. The `except` block lets you handle the error.

### Basic Syntax

```{python}
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code to handle the exception
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
```

### Example

```{python}
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 100 / number
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.")
```

## Handling Multiple Exceptions

You can handle multiple exceptions by specifying multiple `except` blocks.

### Example

```{python}
try:
    file = open("data.txt", "r")
    number = int(file.readline())
    result = 100 / number
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file was not found.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid number in the file.")
```

## `else` Block

The `else` block executes if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block.

### Example

```{python}
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 100 / number
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.")
else:
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

## `finally` Block

The `finally` block lets you execute code, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.

### Example

```{python}
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 100 / number
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.")
else:
    print(f"Result: {result}")
finally:
    print("This block is always executed.")
```

## Raising Exceptions

You can use the `raise` statement to generate an exception if a condition occurs.

### Example

```{python}
def check_positive(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError("The number must be positive")
    return number

try:
    num = check_positive(-10)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

## Custom Exceptions

You can define custom exceptions by creating a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class.

### Example

```{python}
class NegativeNumberError(Exception):
    pass

def check_positive(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise NegativeNumberError("The number must be positive")
    return number

try:
    num = check_positive(-10)
except NegativeNumberError as e:
    print(e)
```

## Introduction to Debugging

Debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors from your code. Python provides several tools for debugging, with `pdb` (Python Debugger) being one of the most powerful and commonly used.

## Using the `pdb` Module

The `pdb` module allows you to set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions at runtime.

### Basic Usage

1. **Importing `pdb`**: You need to import the `pdb` module.
2. **Setting Breakpoints**: Use `pdb.set_trace()` to set a breakpoint.

### Example

```{python}
import pdb

def divide(a, b):
    pdb.set_trace()  # Set a breakpoint
    return a / b

try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(e)
```

### Common `pdb` Commands

- `n` (next): Continue to the next line in the current function.
- `s` (step): Step into the function.
- `c` (continue): Continue execution until the next breakpoint.
- `q` (quit): Quit the debugger.
- `p` (print): Print the value of an expression.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: File Operations

```{python}
import pdb

def read_file(file_path):
    pdb.set_trace()
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = file.read()
            return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found.")
    except IOError:
        print("Error reading file.")

file_content = read_file("non_existent_file.txt")
print(file_content)
```

### Example 2: Network Operations

```{python}
import requests
import pdb

def fetch_data(url):
    pdb.set_trace()
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print("Http Error:", errh)
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print("Error Connecting:", errc)
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print("Timeout Error:", errt)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print("Something went wrong:", err)

data = fetch_data("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
print(data)
```

## Best Practices for Error Handling and Debugging

1. **Be Specific**: Catch specific exceptions rather than a general `Exception`.
2. **Log Errors**: Use logging to record errors for later analysis.
3. **Use `finally` Wisely**: Ensure cleanup actions are always executed.
4. **Avoid Silent Failures**: Don’t suppress exceptions without handling them.
5. **Use Debuggers**: Utilize debuggers like `pdb` to inspect and trace code execution.
6. **Validate Inputs**: Always validate inputs to prevent unexpected errors.
7. **Test Thoroughly**: Write tests to cover different scenarios and edge cases.

## Conclusion

Error handling and debugging are essential skills for writing robust Python code. By using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks effectively, and leveraging the `pdb` module for debugging, you can create more reliable and maintainable applications. Remember to follow best practices to enhance the quality and resilience of your code.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def fetch_data(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.text

def parse_data(html):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    title = soup.find('title').text
    return title

def main():
    try:
        url = 'https://example.com'
        html = fetch_data(url)
        title = parse_data(html)
        print(f"Page Title: {title}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print("HTTP Error:", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Set breakpoints and use the debugger to inspect the `html` and `title` variables.

### Example 2: Debugging a Data Analysis Script

Create a data analysis script using `pandas`.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

def load_data(file_path):
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    return data

def analyze_data(data):
    summary = data.describe()
    return summary

def main():
    try:
        file_path = 'data.csv'
        data = load_data(file_path)
        summary = analyze_data(data)
        print(summary)
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("File not found:", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Set breakpoints and use the debugger to inspect the `data` and `summary` variables.

## Best Practices for Debugging in VSCode

1. **Use Meaningful Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints at critical points in your code to avoid stepping through unnecessary lines.
2. **Leverage Conditional Breakpoints**: Use conditions to trigger breakpoints only when specific criteria are met.
3. **Utilize Watch Expressions**: Monitor the values of variables and expressions to understand their changes over time.
4. **Inspect the Call Stack**: Use the call stack to trace the sequence of function calls leading to the current state.
5. **Log Important Information**: Use log points to output key information without modifying your code.

## Conclusion

VSCode provides a powerful and user-friendly environment for debugging Python code. By leveraging its debugging features, you can quickly identify and fix issues, making your development process more efficient and enjoyable.
