        "# Python Practical: Building Cost-Benefit Analysis Tools Using Python\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, students will use Python to build tools that facilitate cost-benefit analysis, applying their theoretical knowledge in a hands-on setting. Using libraries such as Pandas for data management and Matplotlib or Plotly for visualization, students will create automated systems that can calculate, analyze, and present cost-benefit scenarios. This exercise will enhance both Python programming skills and the ability to apply these skills to real-world economic evaluations in project management.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Prerequisites\n",
        "- Basic understanding of Python programming\n",
        "- Familiarity with cost-benefit analysis concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Setting Up the Python Development Environment\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Install Python\n",
        "Download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Verify Installation\n",
        "Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run the following command to verify that Python is installed correctly:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "python --version\n",
        "```\n",
        "or\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "python3 --version\n",
        "```\n",
        "You should see the installed Python version.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Install Required Libraries\n",
        "Install the necessary libraries using pip:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip install pandas matplotlib plotly\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Loading and Managing Cost-Benefit Data\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Cost-Benefit Data\n",
        "Let's assume we have a CSV file named `cost_benefit_data.csv` with the following columns:\n",
        "- `Item`\n",
        "- `Cost`\n",
        "- `Benefit`\n",
        "- `Year`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 1: Create a Project Directory\n",
        "Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "mkdir cost_benefit_analysis\n",
        "cd cost_benefit_analysis\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 2: Create the Cost-Benefit Analysis Script\n",
        "Create a file named `cost_benefit_analysis.py` and open it in your IDE. Add the following code to load and manage the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import pandas as pd\n",
        "\n",
        "# Load the cost-benefit data\n",
        "data = pd.read_csv('cost_benefit_data.csv')\n",
        "\n",
        "# Display the first few rows of the dataframe\n",
        "print(data.head())\n",
        "\n",
        "# Data preprocessing\n",
        "# Handle missing values\n",
        "data.dropna(inplace=True)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Display basic statistics\n",
        "print(data.describe())\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Discussion:**\n",
        "1. **Loading the Data:** We use Pandas to read the CSV file into a DataFrame. The `read_csv` function is straightforward and automatically detects the structure of the CSV file.\n",
        "2. **Displaying Data:** The `head` function shows the first few rows of the dataset, giving an initial look at the data.\n",
        "3. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values using `dropna` cleans the dataset by removing any rows with missing values.\n",
        "4. **Displaying Statistics:** The `describe` function provides basic statistical details about the dataset, such as mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 3: Run Your Script\n",
        "Run your script from the terminal:\n",
        "```bash\n",

        "## 3. Calculating Net Present Value (NPV)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Define the NPV Function\n",
        "Add the following code to define a function that calculates the NPV of a series of cash flows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def calculate_npv(data, discount_rate):\n",
        "    data['Net Cash Flow'] = data['Benefit'] - data['Cost']\n",
        "    npv = 0\n",
        "    for i, row in data.iterrows():\n",
        "        npv += row['Net Cash Flow'] / ((1 + discount_rate) ** row['Year'])\n",
        "    return npv\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example usage\n",
        "discount_rate = 0.05\n",
        "npv = calculate_npv(data, discount_rate)\n",
        "print(f\"Net Present Value (NPV): ${npv:.2f}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Discussion:**\n",
        "1. **Calculating Net Cash Flow:** The `Net Cash Flow` is calculated as the difference between `Benefit` and `Cost` for each item.\n",
        "2. **Calculating NPV:** The NPV is calculated by discounting each net cash flow to its present value using the formula \\( \\text{NPV} = \\sum \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow}}{(1 + \\text{discount rate})^{\\text{Year}}} \\). This sum gives the NPV of the cash flows.\n",

        "plot_cost_benefit(data)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Discussion:**\n",
        "1. **Plotting Cost and Benefit:** We use Matplotlib's `plot` function to create line plots for `Cost` and `Benefit` over time. The `marker='o'` parameter adds markers to the data points for better visualization.\n",
        "2. **Adding Labels and Titles:** The `xlabel`, `ylabel`, and `title` functions add labels and a title to the plot. The `legend` function adds a legend to differentiate between cost and benefit lines, and `grid` adds grid lines to the plot for better readability.\n",
        "\n",

        "plot_cost_benefit_interactive(data)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Discussion:**\n",
        "1. **Plotly Express:** Plotly Express simplifies the creation of interactive plots. The `line` function creates a line plot with markers.\n",
        "2. **Updating Layout:** The `update_layout` function customizes the layout, including titles for the x and y axes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Run Your Script\n",
        "Run your script from the terminal:\n",
