        "\n",
        "Understanding network architecture and protocols is crucial for designing and managing efficient networks. This tutorial will cover key concepts in network architecture, including IP addressing, subnetting, and routing algorithms. It will also delve into transport layer topics like TCP/UDP protocols, flow control, and error control, and explore application layer protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. We'll use Python libraries like `scapy` for network packet analysis and `socket` for implementing TCP and UDP clients and servers.\n",
