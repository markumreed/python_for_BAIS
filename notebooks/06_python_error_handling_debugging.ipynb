        "\n",
        "Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular IDE that provides powerful debugging tools. Hereâ€™s how to use VS Code for debugging Python code:\n",

        "1. **Set Up a Debug Configuration**:\n",
        "    - Open VS Code and load your Python project.\n",
        "    - Click on the Debug icon on the left sidebar.\n",
        "    - Click on the gear icon to open the `launch.json` file.\n",

        "      }\n",
        "      ```\n",
        "\n",

        "    - Click in the gutter next to the line number where you want to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear, indicating a breakpoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Start Debugging**:\n",
        "    - Click the green play button in the Debug panel or press `F5` to start debugging.\n",
        "    - The program will run until it hits a breakpoint, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and evaluate expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example: Debugging with VS Code\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Open your Python script in VS Code.\n",
        "2. Set a breakpoint in the `calculate_total_price` function.\n",

        "4. **Avoid Silent Failures**: Donâ€™t suppress exceptions without handling them.\n",
        "5. **Use Debuggers**: Utilize debuggers like `pdb` to inspect and trace code execution.\n",
        "6. **Validate Inputs**: Always validate inputs to prevent unexpected errors.\n",

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Error handling and debugging are essential skills for writing robust Python code. By using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks effectively, and leveraging the `pdb` module for debugging, you can create more reliable and maintainable applications. Remember to follow best practices to enhance the quality and resilience of your code.\n",
