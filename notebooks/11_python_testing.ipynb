        "This tutorial covered the basics of using the `pytest` module in Python to write and run tests, including using fixtures, parameterized testing, and some advanced features like test discovery, mocking, and plugins. By following these steps, you should be able to effectively use `pytest` to ensure your business analytics and information systems code works as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial should provide a solid foundation for using `pytest` to test your Python code in business analytics and information systems scenarios. You can extend and adapt these examples to fit the specific needs of your projects."
