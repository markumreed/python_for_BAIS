        "# Python Tutorial: System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with Python\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "This tutorial introduces students to Python programming in the context of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). You will learn to set up a Python development environment, manage packages, and use essential tools for building and testing software applications. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be ready to use Python effectively in various phases of the SDLC.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Prerequisites\n",
        "- Basic understanding of programming concepts\n",
        "- Familiarity with the SDLC phases\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Setting Up the Python Development Environment\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Install Python\n",
        "First, you need to install Python. Download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Verify Installation\n",
        "Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run the following command to verify that Python is installed correctly:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "python --version\n",
        "```\n",
        "or\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "python3 --version\n",
        "```\n",
        "You should see the installed Python version.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n",
        "An IDE can make Python development easier. Popular choices include:\n",
        "- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)\n",
        "- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",
        "- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)\n",
        "\n",
        "For this tutorial, we'll use VS Code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Setting Up Virtual Environments\n",
        "A virtual environment helps manage dependencies for your projects separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Install `virtualenv`:\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    pip install virtualenv\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create a virtual environment:\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    virtualenv myenv\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Activate the virtual environment:\n",
        "    - On Windows:\n",
        "        ```bash\n",
        "        myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "    - On macOS/Linux:\n",
        "        ```bash\n",
        "        source myenv/bin/activate\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "\n",
        "To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "deactivate\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Package Management\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses `pip` to manage packages. To install a package, use:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip install package_name\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, to install `requests`:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip install requests\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "To list installed packages:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip list\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "To uninstall a package:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip uninstall package_name\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Developing Python Applications\n",
