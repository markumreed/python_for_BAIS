        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial introduces students to using Python for project management tasks, specifically creating Gantt charts and detailed project timelines. We will use Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Plotly to visualize project schedules, track critical milestones, and manage timelines effectively. By the end of this tutorial, you will have hands-on experience integrating technical skills with project management theories, enhancing your ability to oversee projects from conception to completion.\n",
