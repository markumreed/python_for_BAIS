# `socket` for basic network communication.

Here’s a tutorial on using the socket library in Python to establish a simple client-server communication. This library is fundamental for network programming in Python, allowing you to create both server and client applications.

## 1. Overview of Socket Programming

Socket programming is a way to enable communication between different processes on the same or different machines. Python’s socket library provides an interface to the socket API and is used to transmit data over the network.

## 2. Setting Up a Basic Server

Here’s how to create a basic server that listens for connections on localhost and a specified port:

```python
import socket

def create_server():
    # Create a socket object using the socket family AF_INET (IPv4) and socket type SOCK_STREAM (TCP)
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Define host and port
    host = 'localhost'
    port = 12345

    # Bind the socket to the host and port
    server_socket.bind((host, port))

    # Start listening for connections, with 5 max queued connections
    server_socket.listen(5)
    print(f"Server is running on {host}:{port}...")

    # Accept connections
    while True:
        client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()
        print(f"Received connection from {addr}")

        # Send a message to the client
        message = 'Hello, thank you for connecting!'
        client_socket.send(message.encode())

        # Close the client socket
        client_socket.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_server()
```

## 3. Creating a Simple Client

Now, let’s write a client that connects to our server:

```python
import socket

def create_client():
    # Create a socket object
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Define host and port
    host = 'localhost'
    port = 12345

    # Connect to the server
    client_socket.connect((host, port))
    print("Connected to the server...")

    # Receive data from the server
    message = client_socket.recv(1024)  # buffer size is 1024 bytes
    print(f"Received from server: {message.decode()}")

    # Close the connection
    client_socket.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_client()
```

## 4. Running the Example

1. **Run the Server**: Start your server script first. It will wait for a connection from a client.
2. **Run the Client**: Start your client script. It will connect to the server, receive a message, and then close the connection.

Sure, let's expand on how to actually run the example of client-server communication using the Python socket library. This process will involve executing both the server and the client scripts on your machine.

### Running the Server and Client

#### Prerequisites
Before running the server and client, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### Steps to Run the Server:

1. **Create the Server Script**:
   - Open your favorite code editor or IDE.
   - Copy the server code provided in the tutorial.
   - Save the file as `server.py`.

2. **Run the Server**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where your `server.py` file is located.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
   - You should see a message indicating that the server is running on localhost at the specified port (e.g., `Server is running on localhost:12345...`).

#### Steps to Run the Client:

1. **Create the Client Script**:
   - Open your code editor or IDE in a new window or tab.
   - Copy the client code provided in the tutorial.
   - Save the file as `client.py`.

2. **Run the Client**:
   - Open a new terminal or command prompt window (do not close the server's terminal).
   - Navigate to the directory where your `client.py` file is located.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     python client.py
     ```
   - The client will connect to the server, receive a message, and display it. You should see output similar to "Connected to the server..." followed by "Received from server: Hello, thank you for connecting!"

#### What to Expect
- When the server is running, it waits for a client to connect and sends a greeting message to any client that connects.
- The client connects, receives the message, prints it, and then closes the connection.

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues:
- **Port Already in Use**: If you get an error saying the port is already in use, either close the application that is using the port or change the port number in both scripts.
- **Connection Refused**: Ensure the server script is running before you start the client script. Also, check that the host and port numbers match in both scripts.

### Conclusion
Running the server and client scripts on your local machine demonstrates basic network communication using Python’s socket library. Experiment with modifying the messages, handling multiple clients, or even using different network protocols to enhance your understanding of network programming.

## 5. Conclusion

This simple example shows how to set up basic client-server communication using sockets in Python. You can extend this by handling multiple clients using threading or asyncio, managing more complex data transfers, or creating more sophisticated network protocols. Socket programming is a powerful tool for creating networked applications.
