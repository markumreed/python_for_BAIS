### 1. Introduction to `unittest`

The `unittest` module is included in Python’s standard library, so you do not need to install anything extra to use it. It allows you to define tests using a class-based approach.

### 2. Writing and Running Tests

#### Step 1: Create the Code to be Tested

Let's create a simple module, `business_metrics.py`, which contains functions to calculate business metrics.

```python
# business_metrics.py

def profit_margin(revenue, cost):
    if revenue == 0:
        raise ValueError("Revenue cannot be zero.")
    return (revenue - cost) / revenue

def roi(gain_from_investment, cost_of_investment):
    if cost_of_investment == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cost of investment cannot be zero.")
    return (gain_from_investment - cost_of_investment) / cost_of_investment

def clv(avg_purchase_value, purchase_frequency, customer_lifespan):
    return avg_purchase_value * purchase_frequency * customer_lifespan
```

#### Step 2: Create the Test Case

Create a new file, `test_business_metrics.py`, to write our unit tests.

```python
# test_business_metrics.py

import unittest
from business_metrics import profit_margin, roi, clv

class TestBusinessMetrics(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_profit_margin(self):
        self.assertAlmostEqual(profit_margin(1000, 400), 0.6)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(profit_margin(500, 500), 0)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            profit_margin(0, 500)

    def test_roi(self):
        self.assertAlmostEqual(roi(1500, 1000), 0.5)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(roi(1000, 1000), 0)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            roi(1500, 0)

    def test_clv(self):
        self.assertEqual(clv(100, 5, 10), 5000)
        self.assertEqual(clv(200, 3, 7), 4200)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

#### Step 3: Run the Tests

You can run the tests using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python test_business_metrics.py
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

OK
```

This indicates that all the tests have passed successfully.

### 3. Using Test Fixtures

Test fixtures are used to provide a fixed baseline upon which tests can reliably and repeatedly execute. This includes setup methods to prepare the environment and teardown methods to clean up after the tests have run.

#### Example with Fixtures

Let's add some setup and teardown methods to our test case.

```python
# test_business_metrics.py

import unittest
from business_metrics import profit_margin, roi, clv

class TestBusinessMetrics(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        print("Setting up test environment...")
        self.revenue = 1000
        self.cost = 400
        self.gain_from_investment = 1500
        self.cost_of_investment = 1000
        self.avg_purchase_value = 100
        self.purchase_frequency = 5
        self.customer_lifespan = 10

    def tearDown(self):
        print("Tearing down test environment...")

    def test_profit_margin(self):
        self.assertAlmostEqual(profit_margin(self.revenue, self.cost), 0.6)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(profit_margin(500, 500), 0)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            profit_margin(0, self.cost)

    def test_roi(self):
        self.assertAlmostEqual(roi(self.gain_from_investment, self.cost_of_investment), 0.5)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(roi(1000, 1000), 0)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            roi(self.gain_from_investment, 0)

    def test_clv(self):
        self.assertEqual(clv(self.avg_purchase_value, self.purchase_frequency, self.customer_lifespan), 5000)
        self.assertEqual(clv(200, 3, 7), 4200)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Run the tests again:

```bash
python test_business_metrics.py
```

Output:

```
Setting up test environment...
.Tearing down test environment...
Setting up test environment...
.Tearing down test environment...
Setting up test environment...
.Tearing down test environment...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

OK
```

### 4. Advanced Features

#### Test Discovery

You can organize your tests in multiple files and use `unittest`'s test discovery feature to automatically find and run all tests.

##### Directory Structure

```
project/
    business_metrics.py
    tests/
        __init__.py
        test_business_metrics.py
        test_other.py
```

##### Run Test Discovery

Run the following command to discover and run all tests in the `tests` directory:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

#### Mocking

The `unittest.mock` module provides a powerful framework for mocking objects and functions in your tests.

```python
# test_business_metrics.py

from unittest.mock import patch

class TestBusinessMetrics(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('business_metrics.profit_margin')
    def test_profit_margin_mock(self, mock_profit_margin):
        mock_profit_margin.return_value = 0.75
        self.assertEqual(profit_margin(1, 2), 0.75)
        mock_profit_margin.assert_called_with(1, 2)
```

#### Test Suites

You can create test suites to group multiple test cases together.

```python
# test_business_metrics.py

import unittest

def suite():
    suite = unittest.TestSuite()
    suite.addTest(TestBusinessMetrics('test_profit_margin'))
    suite.addTest(TestBusinessMetrics('test_roi'))
    return suite

if __name__ == '__main__':
    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
    runner.run(suite())
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial covered the basics of using the `unittest` module in Python to write and run tests, including using test fixtures, running tests, and some advanced features like test discovery, mocking, and test suites. By following these steps, you should be able to effectively use `unittest` to ensure your business analytics and information systems code works as expected.

This tutorial should provide a solid foundation for using `unittest` to test your Python code in business analytics and information systems scenarios. You can extend and adapt these examples to fit the specific needs of your projects.

Certainly! Let's create a deep dive tutorial on the `pytest` package with business analytics and information systems examples. We'll use the same `business_metrics` module as in the previous tutorial but write our tests using `pytest`.

## Deep Dive into `pytest` with Business Examples

The `pytest` package is a powerful testing framework that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases. It offers features such as fixtures, parameterized testing, and a rich plugin architecture.

6. Conclusion

### 1. Introduction to `pytest`

`pytest` is not included in Python’s standard library, so you'll need to install it. You can install `pytest` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

### 2. Writing and Running Tests

#### Step 1: Create the Code to be Tested

We'll use the same `business_metrics.py` module:

```python
# business_metrics.py

def profit_margin(revenue, cost):
    if revenue == 0:
        raise ValueError("Revenue cannot be zero.")
    return (revenue - cost) / revenue

def roi(gain_from_investment, cost_of_investment):
    if cost_of_investment == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cost of investment cannot be zero.")
    return (gain_from_investment - cost_of_investment) / cost_of_investment

def clv(avg_purchase_value, purchase_frequency, customer_lifespan):
    return avg_purchase_value * purchase_frequency * customer_lifespan
```

#### Step 2: Create the Test Case

Create a new file, `test_business_metrics.py`, to write our tests using `pytest`.

```python
# test_business_metrics.py

import pytest
from business_metrics import profit_margin, roi, clv

def test_profit_margin():
    assert profit_margin(1000, 400) == pytest.approx(0.6)
    assert profit_margin(500, 500) == pytest.approx(0)
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        profit_margin(0, 500)

def test_roi():
    assert roi(1500, 1000) == pytest.approx(0.5)
    assert roi(1000, 1000) == pytest.approx(0)
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        roi(1500, 0)

def test_clv():
    assert clv(100, 5, 10) == 5000
    assert clv(200, 3, 7) == 4200
```

#### Step 3: Run the Tests

You can run the tests using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pytest test_business_metrics.py
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
============================= test session starts ==============================
platform linux -- Python 3.8.5, pytest-6.2.4, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1
collected 3 items                                                              

test_business_metrics.py ...                                              [100%]

============================== 3 passed in 0.01s ===============================
```

### 3. Using Fixtures

Fixtures provide a way to set up some context before tests run and clean up afterward. Fixtures are a great way to share setup and teardown code between tests.

#### Example with Fixtures

Let's add some setup fixtures to our test case.

```python
# test_business_metrics.py

import pytest
from business_metrics import profit_margin, roi, clv

@pytest.fixture
def metrics_data():
    return {
        'revenue': 1000,
        'cost': 400,
        'gain_from_investment': 1500,
        'cost_of_investment': 1000,
        'avg_purchase_value': 100,
        'purchase_frequency': 5,
        'customer_lifespan': 10
    }

def test_profit_margin(metrics_data):
    assert profit_margin(metrics_data['revenue'], metrics_data['cost']) == pytest.approx(0.6)
    assert profit_margin(500, 500) == pytest.approx(0)
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        profit_margin(0, metrics_data['cost'])

def test_roi(metrics_data):
    assert roi(metrics_data['gain_from_investment'], metrics_data['cost_of_investment']) == pytest.approx(0.5)
    assert roi(1000, 1000) == pytest.approx(0)
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        roi(metrics_data['gain_from_investment'], 0)

def test_clv(metrics_data):
    assert clv(metrics_data['avg_purchase_value'], metrics_data['purchase_frequency'], metrics_data['customer_lifespan']) == 5000
    assert clv(200, 3, 7) == 4200
```

### 4. Parameterized Testing

Parameterized testing allows you to run the same test function with different sets of parameters.

```python
# test_business_metrics.py

import pytest
from business_metrics import profit_margin, roi, clv

@pytest.mark.parametrize("revenue, cost, expected", [
    (1000, 400, 0.6),
    (500, 500, 0),
])
def test_profit_margin(revenue, cost, expected):
    assert profit_margin(revenue, cost) == pytest.approx(expected)

@pytest.mark.parametrize("gain, cost, expected", [
    (1500, 1000, 0.5),
    (1000, 1000, 0),
])
def test_roi(gain, cost, expected):
    assert roi(gain, cost) == pytest.approx(expected)

@pytest.mark.parametrize("avg_purchase_value, purchase_frequency, customer_lifespan, expected", [
    (100, 5, 10, 5000),
    (200, 3, 7, 4200),
])
def test_clv(avg_purchase_value, purchase_frequency, customer_lifespan, expected):
    assert clv(avg_purchase_value, purchase_frequency, customer_lifespan) == expected
```

### 5. Advanced Features

#### Test Discovery

`pytest` automatically discovers all files matching the pattern `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`. You can organize your tests in multiple files.

##### Directory Structure

```
project/
    business_metrics.py
    tests/
        __init__.py
        test_business_metrics.py
        test_other.py
```

##### Run Test Discovery

Run the following command to discover and run all tests in the `tests` directory:

```bash
pytest
```

#### Mocking

The `pytest-mock` plugin integrates `pytest` with the `unittest.mock` module. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pytest-mock
```

```python
# test_business_metrics.py

def test_profit_margin_mock(mocker):
    mock_profit_margin = mocker.patch('business_metrics.profit_margin')
    mock_profit_margin.return_value = 0.75
    assert profit_margin(1, 2) == 0.75
    mock_profit_margin.assert_called_with(1, 2)
```

#### Plugins

`pytest` has a rich plugin architecture. You can install plugins to extend its functionality.

```bash
pip install pytest-cov
```

Run the tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=business_metrics test_business_metrics.py
```
